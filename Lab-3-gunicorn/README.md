# Lab 3: Gunicorn

**Release the Specters**: Begin by freeing up spectral energies—destroy the lingering vagrant machine from Lab 2 with the incantation "vagrant destroy."

**Summon the Shadows Anew**: Invoke the vagrant file for Lab 3 with the arcane command "vagrant up." Take heed of the mystical lines within the vagrant file that beckon the arrival of Gunicorn, the ethereal steed of WSGI.py. Witness the installation of Nginx—though dormant for now, its presence is a recorded spell for future tomes.

**Scry the Web Realms**: Open your portal to the host machine's web realms. Traverse to http://localhost:9001/ and http://localhost:9001/test to ensure the Flask API is thriving in the ethereal plane. Seek the echoes of "Hello World!" and "Hello from Test!" as confirmation of the API's spectral resonance.

May your journey through Lab 3 be guided by the spirits of flawless execution. Happy conjuring!
