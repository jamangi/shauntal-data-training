1. **Prior Knowledge**: It's strongly recommended to complete "Lab 1: Create a Virtual Machine" first to familiarize yourself with the process of creating and managing virtual machines. If you've previously summoned a machine in that lab and it still lingers, now would be an appropriate time for its dismissal. While you can maintain multiple machines concurrently, it's prudent not to indulge in unnecessary resource consumption.

2. **Navigating to Class Lab 1**: Begin by locating the directory for Class Lab 1. Here, you will initiate the creation of a virtual machine using the command "vagrant up."

3. **Installing Miniconda**: Within the virtual environment, you will find a script named "expect_test.exp" configured to download and install Miniconda. Execute this script by logging into the virtual machine using "vagrant ssh." Once inside, run "./expect_test.exp," and allow it to complete its operations. Subsequently, exit the virtual machine with the "exit" command. Re-enter the virtual machine environment with "vagrant ssh." You will now find yourself within the realm of Miniconda, signifying that Python is available for use. Execute your designated Python script, "./my_python_script.py," to activate Innsbruck's Python script.

4. **Restoration and Consequences**: It is essential to be aware that should you choose to terminate this virtual machine, you will need to re-install Conda manually. To do so, follow the process as described earlier, including the manual input and bash environment reload, which cannot be automated in a script.

These guidelines should aid in your mastery of the rituals outlined in Class Lab 1, ensuring clarity and proficiency in the pursuit of knowledge and skills.
