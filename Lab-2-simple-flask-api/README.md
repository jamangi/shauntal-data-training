# Lab 2: Flask API

1. **Release Lab 1's Restless Spirit**: To begin, journey to the Lab 1 folder in your terminal. If you're still tethered to the Lab 1 Vagrant specter, you must first sever your connection. Use the command "vagrant destroy" to release the restless spirit.

2. **Summon Lab 2's Phantom**: Now, venture into the Lab 2 realm and invoke the virtual machine with "vagrant up." 

3. **Cross the Ethereal Plane**: In this task, we'll need to summon a Python spirit from within the Vagrant ether. To enter this plane, chant "vagrant ssh" and step into the spectral realm.

4. **Summon the Flask App (in the Shadows)**: Once you're within the spectral realm, recite "python3 flaskapi.py &" and then press enter twice to banish the text away from the haunted terminal. The enigmatic "&" symbol beckons the Flask spirit into the shadows. To bring it back from the void, invoke the "fg" command and pause it with the spectral sigil "Ctrl + Z."

5. **Commune with the Flask Apparition**: On the material plane (your host machine), open your web portal and venture to http://localhost:9000/ to commune with the Flask spirit. Verify its presence by the utterance of "Hello World!"

6. **Inspect the Nginx Specter**: Also, traverse to http://localhost:9081/ to ensure the Nginx specter's default incantation is fully manifest.

7. **Banishing the Flask Spirit**: If the time comes to dismantle the Vagrant realm, and the Flask spirit resists, draw it back into the foreground by invoking "fg." To quell its manifestation, cast the ethereal command "Ctrl + C." If the spirit proves resistant, seek counsel and do not hesitate to ask for aid.

You have now harnessed the powers to test a Flask API, working alongside these ethereal entities. In the next lab, we shall delve deeper into the arcane arts of running the app with the otherworldly application server known as Gunicorn.
